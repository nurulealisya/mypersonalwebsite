	<p style="font-family: century gothic; text-align: justify; font-size: 30px;">My class is a typical kindergarten group, in that they are very active and learn best by doing. They are a very talkative group and are in constant competition to share their ideas and to have "their turn" to participate. I have some particularly active boys, one of which is on medication for ADHD, another who has autism, but is currently not receiving special services, and a 3rd who came to me from another district's developmentally delayed kindergarten classroom. The majority of my students can sit still for 20-30 minutes but I have 5 boys who have trouble sitting for just 5 minutes without being disruptive or inattentive. I am challenged to constantly engage my students in their learning, rather than "feed" them information.</p>
